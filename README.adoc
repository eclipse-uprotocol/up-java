= Eclipse uProtocol Java Library
:toc:

== Overview

This library implements the https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/uprotocol-spec/blob/main/languages.adoc[uProtocol Language Specific Library Requirements] for Java defined in https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/uprotocol-spec/tree/main[uProtocol Specifications]. The library is organized into packages that are described in <<sdk-packages>> below. Each package contains a README.adoc file that describes the purpose of the package and how to use it.

The module contains the factory methods, serializers, and validators for all data types defined in the specifications, and any data models that either haven't or couldn't be defined in up-core-api yet.

== Getting Started

| Package | Purpose

| xref:src/main/java/org/eclipse/uprotocol/communication/README.adoc[`*communication*`]
| Top level client-facing  https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/up-spec/tree/main/up-l2[communication layer (uP-L2)] interfaces that applications and services use to implement the publisher/subscriber, notification, and RPC patterns on top of the transport layer (uTransport) API. 

| link:src/main/java/org/eclipse/uprotocol/uri/README.adoc[`*uuri*`]
| Builders, validators, and serializers for uProtocol addressing scheme (UUri). 


| link:src/main/java/org/eclipse/uprotocol/uuid/README.adoc[`*uuid*`] 
| Identifier used to uniquely identify (and timestamp) messages that are sent

| link:src/main/java/org/eclipse/uprotocol/transport/README.adoc[`*transport*`] 
| https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/uprotocol-spec/blob/main/up-l1/README.adoc[uP-L1 Transport Layer] interface and data model that wraps communication middlewares like zenoh, mqtt, http, etc... into a thin and simple to use transport interface. This model is used by the communication layer (uP-L2) to send and receive messages and transports are expected to implement the link:src/main/java/org/eclipse/uprotocol/transport/UTransport.java[uTransport] interface.

| link:src/main/java/org/eclipse/uprotocol/cloudevent/README.adoc[`*cloudevent*`] 
| A representation of uProtocol messages used in older versions of the specifications and kept for backwards compatibility.
