= Eclipse uProtocol Java SDK
:toc:

== Overview

The purpose of this module is to provide language specific code that builds the various data types defined in . The SDK also defines https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/uprotocol-spec/tree/main[uProtocol Specifications]. 

The module contains factory methods and validators for all data types used in uProtocol. 

The SDKs are then used by the code generators to auto-populate service stubs with generated code that builds CloudEvents. For more information on auto-generating service stubs, please refer to http://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/uprotocol[uProtocol Main Project]
