= Eclipse uProtocol Java Library
:toc:

== Overview

This library implements the https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/uprotocol-spec/blob/main/languages.adoc[uProtocol Language Specific Library Requirements] for Java defined in https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/uprotocol-spec/tree/main[uProtocol Specifications]. The library is organized into packages that are described in <<sdk-packages>> below. Each package contains a README.adoc file that describes the purpose of the package and how to use it.

The module contains the factory methods, serializers, and validators for all data types defined in the specifications, and any data models that either haven't or couldn't be defined in up-core-api yet.

== Getting Started

=== Importing the Library
 
To pull the Library from maven central, setting ${uprotocol.version} to the latest version of this library in your pom.xml file:
[source]
----
<!-- uProtocol Core -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.uprotocol</groupId>
    <artifactId>up-java</artifactId>
    <version>${uprotocol.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Using The Library


.Package Folders
[#pkg-folders,width=100%,cols="20%,80%",options="header"]
|===

| Folder | Purpose

| `*builder*` or `*factory*`
| Contains factory methods for creating uProtocol data types

| `*serializer*`
| Contains serializers to convert the objects into byte or string form representation of said object

| `*validator*`
| Contains validators to validate the data types and report errors if the objects are missing or incorrect

| Package | Purpose

| link:src/main/java/org/eclipse/uprotocol/uri/README.adoc[`*uuri*`]
| Uniform Resource Identifier (RFC3986), how uProtocol addresses things (devices, software, methods, topics, etc...) on the network


| link:src/main/java/org/eclipse/uprotocol/uuid/README.adoc[`*uuid*`] 
| Identifier used to uniquely identify (and timestamp) messages that are sent

| link:src/main/java/org/eclipse/uprotocol/transport/README.adoc[`*transport*`] 
| Interface declaration used for bidirectional point-2-point communication between uEs. This interface is then implemented by https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/uprotocol-spec/blob/main/upclient.adoc[uPClient] libraries for a given underlining transport (ex. Binder, MQTT, Zenoh, SOME/IP, DDS, HTTP, etc…​)

| link:src/main/java/org/eclipse/uprotocol/cloudevent/README.adoc[`*cloudevent*`] 
| Common way to represent uProtocol messages using CloudEvent data model used by some transports (ex. MQTT, HTTP, etc…​)

| link:src/main/java/org/eclipse/uprotocol/rpc/README.adoc[`*rpc*`] 
| RPC client and server-side interfaces that are to be implemented by uLink libraries
