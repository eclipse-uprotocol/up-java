== Overview

https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/up-spec/blob/main/basics/cloudevents.adoc[uProtocol CloudEvents] is a common message envelope that could be used to carry uProtocol messages across the transport. CloudEvents were historically used exclusively in older versions of uProtocol (ex. 1.3.6) and as such are maintained in this project for backwards compatibility support.
