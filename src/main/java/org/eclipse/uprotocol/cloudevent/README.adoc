== Overview

https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/uprotocol-spec/blob/main/up-l1/cloudevents.adoc[uProtocol CloudEvents] is a common message envelope that could be used to carry way to represent uProtocol transport layer information `UUri` (source), `UPayload`, and `UAttributes`. `CloudEvents` are used by a number of Device-2-Cloud and Cloud-2-Device based transports such as MQTT and HTTP, however it could also be used by any transport (ex. Binder). 


=== CloudEventFactory
Factory class that builds the various types of CloudEvents for uProtocol (publish, notification, request, response)

== Examples

_Coming soon_, for now please refer to the test folder for examples of how to use CloudEventFactory
