The module includes the interface for the client-facing APIs as well as a simple in-memory implementation that is based on the uP-L2 in-memory implementations. the term in-memory is used to indicate that the data required by the code is cached inside of the object and not persisted to a given database backend, this design is useful for embedded applications (i.e. in the vehicle) however will not scale to the multi-tenanted cloud applications.
